## 💡 Key Design Decisions

### Data Architecture

- **Separation of Concerns**: Data parsing, business logic, and UI components are clearly separated
- **Type Safety**: Comprehensive TypeScript interfaces for all data structures
- **Error Handling**: Graceful fallbacks for API failures and data loading errors

### Performance Optimizations

- **Lazy Loading**: Components load data only when needed
- **Memoization**: React hooks prevent unnecessary re-renders
- **Caching**: Currency rates are cached to reduce API calls

### Code Quality

- **Clean Code**: Self-documenting code with clear naming conventions
- **Reusability**: Modular components and services for easy maintenance
- **Testing Ready**: Structure supports easy unit and integration testing

## 🌐 Currency Conversion

The dashboard integrates with [ExchangeRate-API](https://exchangerate-api.com/) for real-time currency conversion:

- **Real-time Rates**: Fetches current exchange rates on demand
- **Fallback Rates**: Static rates used when API is unavailable
- **Caching**: Rates cached for 5 minutes to reduce API calls
- **Error Handling**: Graceful degradation when conversion fails
