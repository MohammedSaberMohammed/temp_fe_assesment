## 💡 Key Design Decisions

### Data Architecture
- **Separation of Concerns**: Data parsing, business logic, and UI components are clearly separated
- **Type Safety**: Comprehensive TypeScript interfaces for all data structures
- **Error Handling**: Graceful fallbacks for API failures and data loading errors

### Performance Optimizations
- **Lazy Loading**: Components load data only when needed
- **Memoization**: React hooks prevent unnecessary re-renders
- **Caching**: Currency rates are cached to reduce API calls

### User Experience
- **Loading States**: Clear visual feedback during data loading
- **Error Recovery**: Retry mechanisms for failed operations
- **Responsive Design**: Works seamlessly on all device sizes

### Code Quality
- **Clean Code**: Self-documenting code with clear naming conventions
- **Reusability**: Modular components and services for easy maintenance
- **Testing Ready**: Structure supports easy unit and integration testing

## 🌐 Currency Conversion

The dashboard integrates with [ExchangeRate-API](https://exchangerate-api.com/) for real-time currency conversion:

- **Real-time Rates**: Fetches current exchange rates on demand
- **Fallback Rates**: Static rates used when API is unavailable
- **Caching**: Rates cached for 5 minutes to reduce API calls
- **Error Handling**: Graceful degradation when conversion fails

## 📊 Data Visualization

### Enhanced Chart Suite
- **Clean Metric Cards**: Key performance indicators with icons and proper formatting
- **Interactive Donut Charts**: 
  - Amount distribution (collected vs outstanding)
  - Invoice status (paid vs unpaid)
  - Project portfolio distribution
  - Budget code allocation
- **Responsive Vertical Bar Charts**: 
  - Side-by-side vertical bars for invoiced (blue) vs paid (green) amounts
  - Auto-adjusts to parent container width
  - Animated bar transitions with payment rate indicators
  - Responsive text labels that rotate on smaller screens
- **Smart Number Formatting**: K/M abbreviations for better readability
- **Hover Tooltips**: Detailed information on demand

## 🎨 Design System

### Color Palette
- **Primary**: Blue shades for main actions and highlights
- **Success**: Green for paid amounts and positive states
- **Warning**: Yellow for pending states
- **Error**: Red for outstanding amounts and errors
- **Neutral**: Gray shades for text and backgrounds

### Typography
- **Headings**: Clear hierarchy with proper font weights
